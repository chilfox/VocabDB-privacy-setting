<h2>Privacy Policy for VocabDB</h2>
<p>skfoxwh built the VocabDB app as a free app. This SERVICE is provided by skfoxwh at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

<p>This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>

<p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the information handling practices described in this policy.</p>

<p><strong>Information Collection and Storage</strong></p>
<p>VocabDB is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal information on our servers. All vocabulary data, study progress, and app settings are stored locally on your device only.</p>

<p>The app does not require user registration, login, or any form of account creation. No personal information such as names, email addresses, or other identifying information is requested or collected.</p>

<p><strong>Local Data Storage</strong></p>
<p>All data created within the VocabDB app (including your vocabulary lists, study progress, and preferences) is stored locally on your device. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>

<p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
<p>We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in case of an error in the app, we may collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. This information is only used for debugging purposes and is not linked to any personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>VocabDB does not use cookies or any similar tracking technologies. We do not track your usage patterns or collect analytics data about how you use the app.</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Services</strong></p>
<p>VocabDB does not integrate with any third-party services that would have access to your data. The app operates independently and does not share information with external services.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Since all your data is stored locally on your device, the security of your information depends on your device's security measures. We recommend keeping your device updated and using appropriate security features like screen locks.</p>

<p><strong>Data Backup and Transfer</strong></p>
<p>Because data is stored locally, it is your responsibility to back up your vocabulary data if desired. If you uninstall the app or reset your device, your VocabDB data may be lost unless you have backed it up through your device's backup system.</p>

<p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Our Service is suitable for users above age 13 . Since we do not collect any personal information, there are no additional privacy concerns for users. However, we recommend parental guidance for younger users.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app or on our distribution platform. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.</p>

<p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
